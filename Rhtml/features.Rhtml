<h2> Overview of Feature Values</h2>

The following measures were taken for the results of each feature:
<ul>

  <li> <a>obs (number of observations within the feature set)</a>
  <li> <a>NAs (number of NAs, i.e., missing values, within the feature set)</a>
  <li> <a>min (minimum), mean (arithmetic mean), max (maximum), std_dev (standard deviation)</a>
  <li> <a>1st_qu (1st quartile = lower quartile = 25%-quantile)</a>
  <li> <a>median (median = 50%-quantile)</a>
  <li> <a>3rd_qu (3rd quartile = upper quartile = 75%-quantile)</a>
  <li> <a>co_var (coefficient of variation = standard deviation / arithmetic mean)</a>

</ul>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = summarizeFeatureValues(astask)
  print(xtable(res, display = c("s", "d", "d", rep("g", 8))), "html")
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Summary of feature steps </h2>

The following table summarizes the feature steps over all instances.
<ul>
  <li> size (percentage of features affected by this step)
  <li> ok, ..., other (percentage of run status)
  <li> cost_min, cost_mean, cost_max (range of costs for this step)
  <li> cost_na (percentage of missing values occuring in costs)
</ul>

<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = summarizeFeatureSteps(astask)
  print(xtable(res, display = c("s", "d", rep("g", ncol(res) - 1L))), "html")
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Duplicated Features </h2>

Underneath, you'll find all features that adopted only one value (and eventually NA's). Please note, that only a maximum of 5 duplicates per block are shown.<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = checkDuplicatedInstances(astask)
  if (length(res) > 0L) {
    numbers = sapply(res, length)
    res = sapply(seq_along(res), function(i) {
      if (numbers[i] > 5)
        res[[i]] = c(res[[i]][1:5], "...")
      collapse(res[[i]], sep = " +++++++ ")
    })
    res = data.frame(block = seq_along(numbers), numbers = numbers, instances = res)
    print(xtable(res), include.rownames = FALSE, "html")
  } else {
    cat("There were no duplicated features.")
  }
end.rcode-->
